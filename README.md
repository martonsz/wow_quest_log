# wow_quest_log
A World of Warcraft log parser with a webpage for showing accepted and completed quests.

Me and my friend started to play World of Warcraft classic and wanted to track each others quests.
This project parses the wow chat log for quest events and saves it to a database. The quests are shown in a very simple webpage using Flask.
